:wave: Hi, I'm Josselin Lef√®vre, a PhD student collaborating with Thermo Fisher Scientific and LIGM.

My doctoral research focuses on tackling challenges in **Hierarchical Segmentation under Memory Constraints**, with a keen interest in Interactive Segmentation. By enhancing these methods, my goal is to enable the hierarchical toolbox to efficiently process large-scale images, opening doors to broader applications in image analysis.

I hold an Engineering Degree in Computer Science from [ESIEE Paris](https://www.esiee.fr), where I graduated with honors, specializing in Image Processing.
