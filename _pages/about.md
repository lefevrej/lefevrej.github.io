:wave: I'm Josselin Lef√®vre, a PhD student at Thermo Fisher Scientific and LIGM.

In my doctoral research, I'm addressing challenges related to **Hierarchical Segmentation under Memory Constraint**. I am also interested in interactive segmentation. In this way, it will be possible to extend the application of the hierarchical toolbox to the processing of large images.

I obtained an engineering degree in computer science at [ESIEE Paris](https://www.esiee.fr) with honors with a specialization in **Image Processing**.
